# nato-alphabet-in-python
This code reads in a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet and creates a dictionary where each letter is a key and its corresponding code is the value. Then, the generate_phonetic() function asks the user to input a word, and it converts each letter in the word to its corresponding NATO phonetic code using the dictionary. If the user inputs a non-alphabetic character, an error message is displayed and the function is recursively called until a valid word is input. Finally, the function prints the list of NATO phonetic codes corresponding to the input word.
